# Simple E-commerce Website

This project is a lightweight clone of popular e‑commerce platforms like Amazon and Flipkart.
It demonstrates a basic product catalogue, shopping cart and user login pages built with
plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. All data is stored in the browser using `localStorage`,
so there is no backend required.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in your browser to explore the demo store. Feel free to modify the
product catalogue in `js/products.js` or enhance the styling in `css/style.css`.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – Home page with product listings
- `products.html` – Example product catalogue
- `product.html` – Product detail template
- `cart.html` – Shopping cart
- `login.html` – Dummy login form
- `css/` – Styling
- `js/` – JavaScript logic and product data

This repository does not contain a production-ready system—it is a teaching example
for how a simple online store might be structured.
